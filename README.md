# Flask-Web-Application-with-CI-CD

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Python Flask web application using Jenkins, Docker, and a local RHEL-based Linux environment. It showcases how to automate the build, test, and deployment stages using open-source DevOps tools.

Tech Stack:
1. Jenkins - Automates build, test, and deployment
2. Docker - Containerizes the flask application
3. Flask - Lightweight Python web framework
4. Git - Source code version control
5. Linux (RHEL) - Host machine for Jenkins and Docker
